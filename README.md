</p>

Hazard Hunt is an Android game for skills trainees in Bangladesh that teaches occupational safety and health (OSH). The player is a site supervisor. Each case shows an unsafe workplace, the player finds the hazards and answers questions, and then sees the same place made safe. The game runs offline, in Bangla or English, on low-cost phones.

## Cases

The construction sector has 8 cases. Garments (RMG) and light engineering are planned.

| # | Case | What the trainee practises |
|---|------|----------------------------|
| 1 | Bamboo scaffold: work at height | Finding hazards, hierarchy of controls, persuading a worker, PPE |
| 2 | Morning gate check | Checking each worker's helmet, boots and vest at the gate |
| 3 | Temporary electrical wiring | Lock-out tag-out, earth-leakage breakers, shock first aid |
| 4 | Foundation trench | Permit to work: mark each condition, then approve or refuse |
| 5 | Floor openings and edges | Covers, guardrails, safe carrying |
| 7 | Concrete mixer and rebar | Machine guards, loose clothing, cement dust, rebar caps |
| 8 | Crane lifting | Slings, tag lines, exclusion zones, the signaller's job |
| 12 | Near-miss investigation | Evidence board, open interview questions, 5 Whys, action plan |

Every question has a free **Hint**, and **Show answer** appears after a wrong try, so nobody gets stuck. Stars reward getting it right first time.
